# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays  
**Mathematical Modeling Course - Exam Project**  

## Overview  
This project applies linear classification techniques to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using the MedMNIST dataset. The goal is to explore how different feature extraction methods affect model performance, especially under small dataset constraints.

## Tasks  
- Build and improve linear models for binary classification  
- Apply regularization to prevent overfitting  
- Extract features from raw pixels, image gradients, and histogram-based patches  
- Evaluate model accuracy and interpret learned weights  
- Compare feature strategies based on performance and interpretability
